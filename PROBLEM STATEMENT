Identified Problems :
Operational Problems
Heavy dependence on grid electricity for continuous dewatering
Frequent use of diesel generators during power outages
High operational expenditure (OPEX) due to electricity + diesel
Unreliable pump operation in remote mining conditions
Pump downtime during grid failure → flooding risks

Environmental Problems
High carbon emissions from diesel-powered backup systems
Lack of sustainable energy integration in mining operations

Management & Maintenance Problems
Manual supervision required for pump operation and monitoring
Maintenance burden from diesel gensets and electrical panels
Inefficient traditional dewatering setup with no smart automation

Financial & Deployment Problems
HCL wants zero CAPEX → needs OPEX/PPA model
Need for vendor-managed O&M to eliminate HCL’s internal cost
Need for scalable and site-specific pump deployment

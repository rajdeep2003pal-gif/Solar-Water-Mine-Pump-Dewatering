1. Site Preparation

Conduct site survey for sunlight, pump location, and safety.

Clear and level ground for solar array installation.

Identify cable routing and battery room location.

2. System Installation
Solar Plant Setup

Install mounting structures and fix solar panels.

Install MPPT charge controller + sensors + tracker (if used).

Connect DC cables, protection devices, earthing & surge protectors.

Battery & Power System

Install LiFePO₄ battery bank (80 kWh or chosen capacity).

Install BMS and battery protection circuitry.

Connect hybrid system: Solar → Battery → Pump Controller.

Pump & Motor Integration

Install energy-efficient pump (21 kW).

Connect to VFD/soft starter for controlled startup.

Link pump controller to IoT system for monitoring.

3. System Activation & Testing
Pre-Start Checks

Verify panel voltage and MPPT functioning.

Check battery charge, temperature, and BMS logs.

Test pump dry-run protections and flow sensors.

System Start-Up

Start pump in solar-battery hybrid mode.

Monitor power flow (solar → battery → pump).

Validate flow rate, head pressure & amperage.

Performance Testing

2–3 days trial run under actual mining conditions.

Calibrate tracking, dust-cleaning system & IoT alerts.

Compare diesel vs. solar performance.

4. Operation & Monitoring

Real-time tracking via IoT dashboard (energy, pump status, battery).

Daily automatic dust cleaning & panel alignment.

Periodic maintenance (monthly inspection, quarterly service).

5. Handover & Training

Train HCL personnel for routine operation.

Provide documentation: SOP, safety guidelines, troubleshooting.

Set up maintenance schedule and emergency support plan.
